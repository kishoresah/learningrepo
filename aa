Bank's reconciliation employee's report to his supervisor that his bag of cash was stolen by miscreants when he was on his way to branch. The bag contained repayment amount belonging to several customers. After a month, it was discovered that the robbery was orchestrated and the miscreants were accomplices of the collections employee who reported the event. You are the operational risk manager for the bank. Please indicate which loss event category would you choose in light of this new information.

ChatGPT said:
Given the new information, the correct operational loss event category is:

✅ Internal Fraud

Why:

The collections employee intentionally orchestrated the robbery

The miscreants were accomplices, not external criminals

This involves misappropriation of assets and intentional misconduct by an employee

Under Basel operational risk event types, this clearly falls under Internal Fraud, not External Fraud or Theft.


You said:
which of the following steps of operational risk involve going through the audit report? Mitigation, Monitoring, Identifying, Assessing.

ChatGPT said:
The correct answer is:

✅ Identifying

Why:
Audit reports are reviewed to identify operational risk events, control weaknesses, and process gaps. This helps in spotting existing or potential risks before they are assessed, monitored, or mitigated.


You said:
The following definitions belong to the which loss event category: losing arising from an unintentional or negligent failure to meet a professional obligation to clients, including fiduciary and suitability requirements. Option: Employment practice and workplace safety, number two, execution, delivery, and process management, client products and business practices, damage to physical assets.

ChatGPT said:
The correct loss event category is:

✅ Client, Products and Business Practices

Why:
This category covers losses arising from unintentional or negligent failure to meet professional obligations to clients, including fiduciary duties and suitability requirements—which is exactly what the definition describes.

So from the given options, choose:
👉 client products and business practices


You said:
It is not a beneficial or personal risk. Number one, effective and reliable operations, better regulatory compliance. Number three, increase customer and staff satisfaction, increase in regulatory capital.

ChatGPT said:
The correct answer is: Increase in regulatory capital ❌

Why:
Operational risk management is meant to reduce risk and losses, which leads to:

✅ Effective and reliable operations

✅ Better regulatory compliance

✅ Increased customer and staff satisfaction

But it does NOT increase regulatory capital—in fact, good risk management often helps optimize or reduce capital requirements, not increase them.

So, among the listed points, the one that is NOT a beneficial/personal risk outcome is:

👉 Increase in regulatory capital


You said:
Economic downturn in the country, external event resulted in loss of employment for many unsecured loan borrowers. The borrowers were unable to pay their loan obligation due to downturn. As a result, the bank had to write off 5% of unsecured loans portfolio, which are the underlying causes, OCC scenario, and operational risk just on law.

ChatGPT said:
Let’s break it cleanly, step by step 👇

1️⃣ Underlying causes
Economic downturn / recession

Loss of employment among borrowers

Reduced repayment capacity of unsecured loan customers
👉 These are macroeconomic factors, outside the bank’s control.

2️⃣ OCC scenario (event type)
External Event – Economic / Macroeconomic Downturn

Under OCC-style scenarios, this falls under:

Adverse economic conditions

Systemic external factors impacting borrowers

3️⃣ Is this an Operational Risk? (justify as per definition/law)
❌ No — this is NOT operational risk

✅ This is Credit Risk

Justification:

Losses arose due to borrowers’ inability to repay loans

Caused by economic conditions, not by:

failed processes

people misconduct

system failure

external fraud or events affecting operations

As per Basel/OCC definitions:

Credit risk losses (loan defaults, write-offs) are explicitly excluded from operational risk.

✅ Final classification
Underlying cause: Economic downturn & unemployment

OCC scenario: External economic event / recession

Risk type: Credit Risk (not Operational Risk)

If you want, I can also map this to Basel II/III wording for exam-ready answers.


You said:
Definition of operational risk. The risk of gain or loss resulting from inadequate or failed process, people, system, procedural events. Number two, the risk of actual potential loss resulting from inadequate or failed process, people, system, external events. The risk of loss resulting from inadequate failed process, people, and system and external events. The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed process, people, and system or external events.

ChatGPT said:
The correct definition of operational risk is:

✅ The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, and systems or from external events.

Why:
This matches the Basel definition word-for-word.
Other options are incorrect because they:

Mention gain (operational risk is defined in terms of loss)

Miss external events

Use incorrect wording like procedural events or actual/potential gain

👉 Correct choice: Number 4


You said:
is operationl risk is subset of operation disk, true or false?

ChatGPT said:
❌ False

Why:
Operational risk is not a subset of “operation risk/operation disk.”
In banking and risk management, operational risk is its own standalone risk category, alongside credit risk and market risk.

So the statement is false.
