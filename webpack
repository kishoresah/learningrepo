webpack issue not refresh hot in next js

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67030855/next-js-not-auto-refreshing

Fast Refresh was broken for us because we were using a custom webpack config in our next.config.js that set React and ReactDOM as externals.

Ensuring both React and ReactDOM were included in the bundle while in local development fixed the issue for us.

const isDev = NODE_ENV === 'development'

module.exports = {
  webpack: config => {
    if (isDev) {
      return config;
    }

    return {
      ...config,
      externals: {
        react: 'React',
        'react-dom': 'ReactDOM',
      },
    };
  },
};

-------------------
in my case hot reload didn't work because there was assetsPrefix in my next.config.js. You can remove or change them to "/" in the development mode and everything will be as expected.
In my case, I removed the assetPrefix in my next.config.js file and now hot reloading is working now

---------------------

// Opt-in to Webpack hot module replacement
if (module.hot) module.hot.accept()

module.exports = {

    devServer: {
        hot: true,
    },

}
=====================
devServer: {
    port: 3000,
    hot: false,
    liveReload: true,
  },

==============
devServer: {
    hotOnly: true,
},

=======
devServer: {
    port: 8080,
    contentBase: ['./src', './public'], // both src and output dirs
    inline: true,
    hot: true
},
